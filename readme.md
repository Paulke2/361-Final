How to run: 
first put the desired input in input.txt
then in your terminal, run <gcc main.c>
then once again in your terminal, run <./a.exe>

input: the input should be a set of instructions that tell our simulated operating system what to do. the 'D' instruction prints the current state of the CPU.

output: the output will be the state of the CPU after each process terminates.
